This project represents my first experience with C# post college graduation. Wanted to code in C# and in a .net environment for 
first time since I've mainly programmed in C and C++ on linux machines during my college years. This program creates a 
windows form that collects only URL text. Utilized handler functions to grab and manage text that are dragged into the 
windows form, as well as functions that handles options that are clicked in the windows menu.
